# RomCom  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
If you're tired of the same cookie-cutter romance novels, then this app is for you. Our app's main page displays a randomly generated book cover. The user has the option to repeatedly generate new, random book covers and save whichever ones they would like to add to their collection. The user may view their book cover collection and remove whichever covers they no longer wish to keep. The user also has the option to generate a personalized book cover, which they can add to their collection.

### Installation Instructions:

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
This project took about 2 days to complete. Both contributors are in week 2 of Mod 1 of the Turing program.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
- Explore the connection between JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
We practiced creating dynamic functions in JavaScript as well as updating elements on the DOM.

- Document changes with commits and code review
We practiced writing thorough pull-requests in order to clearly convey the project's history and evolution. We also practiced using new branches for any changes made and reviewing those changes before merging.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
**Wins**
1. We both learned and grew as a result of the Git Flow. We initially only made commits after an iteration, but began to understand the importance of more frequent commits. This allowed us to track the project's growth and also have previous versions of our project at our disposal.
2. We learned to adapt to each other's workstyle and schedule. We made sure to not only focus on group objectives, but also to each other's individual concerns. We regularly checked in with each other to make sure we're on the same page.

**Challenges**
1. Familiarizing ourselves with the Git Flow was quite challenging. We ran into several technical difficulties when creating pull requests and pulling changes from GitHub. To overcome this, we took a step back and closely read the Git Flow page to make sure we were following instructions.
2. Working in two, very different timezone proved to be a bit difficult. Although we both needed to compromise, we were receptive to each other's needs.
